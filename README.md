### Just Another Text Editor
Just Another Text Editor (JATE) is a Progressive Web App (PWA) compliant text editor that runs in the browser.  This is a single-page application and features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser.  This application functions offline as well.
